 Basic Tree Operations:
   Inserting an element to Tree
   Deletion of element
   Searching for element
   Traversing the tree
   Size of Tree
   Height of Tree
   level with max sum
   Least Common Ancestors.
   
   Type of Traversals: Inorder, PreOrder and PostOrder( Recursive and Non-Recursive)
   
   Maximum Element in Binary Tree
   Maximum element without Recursion
   Search an element in tree
   Search without recursion
   insert into tree
   size of tree without recursion
   revserse order printing
   deleting a tree
   Height withoout recursion
   Deepest Node in Binary Tree
   Number of leaves without recursion
   number of full Nodes without Recursion
   Number of half Nodes without Recursion
   Check if both are structurally Identical
   Diameter of BinaryTree
   level with maximum sum in Tree
   print all root to leaf paths
   Existance of path with given sum
   sum of all elements in Tree with/without recursion
   convert tree to mirror
