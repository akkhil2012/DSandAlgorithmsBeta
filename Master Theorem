Let a  1 and b>1 be constants, and let f .n/ be a nonnegative function defined
on exact powers of b. A function g.n/ defined over exact powers of b by
g.n/ D
log
Xb n1
jD0
aj f .n=bj / (4.22)
has the following asymptotic bounds for exact powers of b:
1. If f .n/ D O.nlogb a/ for some constant >0, then g.n/ D O.nlogb a/.
2. If f .n/ D ‚.nlogb a/, then g.n/ D ‚.nlogb a lg n/.
3. If af .n=b/  cf .n/ for some constant c<1 and for all sufficiently large n,
then g.n/ D ‚.f .n//.
